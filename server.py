    agy's `--print` takes the prompt as its own inline argv value —
    it has no stdin fallback (`agy --print ""` errors rather than
    reading stdin). The prompt must therefore sit immediately after
    `--print`, and `--print-timeout` must be passed as a single
    `=`-joined token so it can't be swallowed as --print's value
    instead of the real prompt.

    agy's workspace is registered via `--add-dir`, not inherited from
    the subprocess's working directory — setting the subprocess cwd
    alone leaves agy rooted in its own default scratch directory, blind
    to the actual project. So `cwd` is passed to agy as its own
    `--add-dir` entry (in addition to being the subprocess's OS-level
    working directory, set separately in `_run_agy`).

    Access tier is mutually exclusive: trust (--dangerously-skip-
    permissions) wins over sandbox. Multi-turn context is handled by
    Castor's own transcript replay, not agy's --continue.

    The sandbox tier passes --sandbox together with
    --dangerously-skip-permissions. Since agy 1.3, headless print mode
    auto-denies every shell command outside trust (allow-rules in
    settings.json did not match either, tested on agy 1.4.7), and one
    denial ends the turn with empty output and exit 0. Auto-approving
    inside --sandbox lets agy run find/grep/git while the OS sandbox
    keeps the workspace read-only. Confirmed live on 1.4.7: writes to
    the workspace fail with "Operation not permitted", but writes to
    the home directory and network access still succeed, so this tier
    protects the project, not the whole machine.

    `--disable-slash-commands` is always passed: Castor's prompts
    routinely inline arbitrary file/directory content, and inlined
    text that happens to start with `/` at the start of a line must
    never be interpreted by agy as a skill invocation rather than
    inert content handed over for analysis.

    `agent`, like `model`, is passed straight through with no
    server-side validation — an unknown agent name is rejected by agy
    itself. `json_schema` is internal-only (no public tool param sets
    it directly): when set, it also switches `--output-format` to
    `stream-json`, since agy only enforces `--json-schema` on the
    terminal result event of that format — see _json_schema_args.

    Note: agy's `--mode` flag (accept-edits/plan) was spiked and
    deliberately left out of this command builder entirely.
    `accept-edits` hangs headless `--print` calls waiting for an
    approval prompt that can never be answered non-interactively.
    `plan` doesn't hang, but adds no real capability: without
    trust/sandbox it's a silent no-op (any tool request auto-denied),
    and with trust it behaves identically to omitting `--mode`
    entirely. Neither is worth the added API surface — see the design
    doc's item #10 for the full spike writeup.

        The full argv list for the agy subprocess.

    as stdin piping would allow.

        prompt: The fully-assembled prompt to send to agy.
        trust: If True, pass --dangerously-skip-permissions so agy
            auto-approves tool actions (writes, commands).

            workspace so it explores the correct project.

            repeated --add-dir flags.
        model: If set, pass --model <model> to select the agy model.
            Call gemini_models for the available names.

            run read commands while the workspace stays read-only (see

            broader grant).
        effort: If set, pass --effort <effort> to select agy's reasoning
            effort (low/medium/high/xhigh/max). Not validated
            server-side; an invalid value is rejected by agy itself.
        agent: If set, pass --agent <agent> to route the prompt to one
            of agy's built-in specialized agents (see gemini_agents).
            Not validated server-side; an unknown name is rejected by
            agy itself.

    Use this to offload large-context work — file exploration, indexing,
    summarization, cross-file analysis, research. Claude should construct
    a thoughtful prompt that leads with task context (what you are doing
    and where you are in the task), followed by a specific ask.
    See GEMINI.md for the full prompting guide.

    agy explores the workspace on its own when rooted via `cwd`, so
    prefer that over inlining. Only pass `files` or `directory` to inline
    content when the user explicitly named specific files.

    For multi-step work against the same codebase, pass a `session` name
    (or continue_session=True for the default session) so the prior
    transcript is replayed as context. Sessions are Castor-owned and
    project-scoped (they require cwd), and they survive restarts. Clear
    the default session with gemini_reset; manage named ones with
    gemini_sessions / gemini_session_delete.

    Args:
        prompt: The fully-formed prompt Claude has constructed.
        files: Absolute paths to files to inline into the prompt.
        directory: A directory whose contents should be inlined.

        trust: If True, pass --dangerously-skip-permissions so agy
            auto-approves tool actions (writes, commands). Requires
            `cwd`. Default False keeps agy read-only.
        cwd: Working directory for the agy subprocess. Required when
            using trust=True, and whenever a session is used (sessions
            are project-scoped). Pass the absolute project path.
        add_dirs: Extra directories to grant agy read access to (via
            --add-dir) without inlining them. Lets agy explore them.
        continue_session: Convenience flag — resume the project's default
            session ("__default__"). Equivalent to session="__default__".
            Ignored when `session` is set explicitly. Requires cwd.
        session: Name a project-scoped conversation to continue (e.g.
            "refactor-auth"). Castor replays its transcript as context and
            appends this turn on success. Requires cwd. Session calls are
            stateful and never cached.
        model: Select the agy model (e.g. a faster model for light
            summarization, a stronger one for deep reasoning). Call
            gemini_models for the available names. Defaults to agy's
            configured default.
        effort: Select agy's reasoning effort (low/medium/high/xhigh/
            max): a cheap/fast-vs-capable tradeoff independent of
            model choice.
            Defaults to agy's own default when omitted.
        agent: Route the prompt to one of agy's built-in specialized
            agents (e.g. "security-engineer", "root-cause-analyst").
            Call gemini_agents for the available names. Defaults to
            agy's own default agent when omitted.
        sandbox: If True, agy explores the filesystem and auto-approves
            read commands (find/grep/git) inside agy's OS sandbox, which
            keeps the workspace read-only. Writes outside the workspace
            and network access are not blocked. The middle ground
            between read-only (where any shell command is auto-denied)
            and trust. Ignored when trust=True.
        use_cache: If True (default), reuse a stored response when the
            same prompt is re-sent against an unchanged repo (matched by
            git HEAD + working-tree state). Only side-effect-free calls

    or `directory`, which Castor inlines. Use it for second opinions,
    review/summarize/explain over content you supply, or to spread load
    when agy's free quota is tight. For open-ended exploration of a
    codebase, prefer gemini_prompt with cwd.

    Privacy: everything inlined is sent to NVIDIA's hosted API. Free-tier
    data-use terms are NVIDIA's; do not send secrets or code the user has
    not cleared for a third party.

    Requires NVIDIA_API_KEY in the MCP server's environment — run
    nim_status to check. The call blocks until the model answers (up to
    CASTOR_NIM_TIMEOUT, default 180s); use nim_start for long prompts.

    Args:

        continue_session: Resume the project's default session
            ("__default__"). Ignored when `session` is set. Requires cwd.
        session: Name a project-scoped conversation to continue. Castor
            replays its transcript and appends this turn on success.
            Requires cwd. Session calls are never cached. Sessions are
            shared with gemini_prompt, so the same name continues across
            backends.
        model: NIM model id, e.g. "meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct". Call
            nim_models for what is available. Defaults to
            CASTOR_NIM_MODEL, then a built-in default.
        use_cache: If True (default), reuse a stored response for an
            identical prompt/model. Session calls are never cached.
        temperature: Sampling temperature 0 to 2 (default 0.2).
        max_tokens: Completion cap (default 4096, CASTOR_NIM_MAX_TOKENS).
